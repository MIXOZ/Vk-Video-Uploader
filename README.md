# Vk-video-downloader

App, that allows upload videos to your VK profile.
[APK](https://github.com/MIXOZ/Vk-video-downloader/blob/master/app-release-unsigned.apk)

## Two modes of operation
  App can continue uploading on background, or it will upload videos only on foreground.

## Re-upload the video from the moment where the connection was broken, avoiding re-uploading from the beginning
  Just choose the video, that you were uploading, and it will continue uploading from the moment where it was interrupted.

## It is possible to pause and cancel the upload
